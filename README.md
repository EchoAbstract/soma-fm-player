Soma FM Player
==============

A simple player for the streams at [Soma FM](http://somafm.com/).

This project is *not* affiliated with Soma FM, it's a personal project that
happens to use their awesome service.  Consider
[donating](http://somafm.com/support/) to Soma FM if you enjoy their service.


This project was started because of limitations with the pop-up web player for
SomaFM as well as the annoying support for streams in iTunes and VLC (both of
which work fine, but are too general for when I'm listening at work).

## Features

* Can use Macbook media keys to start and stop the stream (thanks to
  https://gist.github.com/gauravk92/546311).
* App icon shows the currently playing stream.
* Station menu available in dock icon, main menu and in the media player menu
  in the app itself.
* Key commands for my favorite streams.

## Currently listed streams

* [Drone Zone (⌘1)](http://somafm.com/dronezone/)
* [Lush (⌘6)](http://somafm.com/lush/)
* [Underground 80's (⌘3)](http://somafm.com/u80s/)
* [PopTron (⌘2)](http://somafm.com/poptron/)
* [Seven Inch Soul](http://somafm.com/7soul/)
* [Suburbs of Goa](http://somafm.com/suburbsofgoa/)
* [Deep Space One](http://somafm.com/deepspaceone/)
* [DEF CON Radio (⌘4)](http://somafm.com/defcon/)
* [SF 10-33 (⌘5)](http://somafm.com/sf1033/)


## TODO

* Get current track listing
* Do something with the media player display
* Don't pause the stream, stop it and restart it (maybe only after a certain
  delay...)
* Add the rest of Soma FM's streams
* Add a tool to fetch the streams and logos and dynamically build the list
